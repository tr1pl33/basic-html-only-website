# basic-html-only-website
This is a website made only with html. I know, css is better, but i was learning html so i thought i should make a site containing all the html things i learned
The website contains notes, written in bulgarian with english symbols. It's pretty easy to make, but most people including me prefer using css along html as it makes the website looks better, etc.
